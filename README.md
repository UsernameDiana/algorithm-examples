# Airline Graph

* In this project were suposed read from a text file, sort the data, and search through it with deaph first and then breath first search.

To start the breadth first search, we need the linked graph, witch we are currently trying to get implemented properly.
We have tryed to read from the airplane text file providet, but been unsuccessful to collect the needed data to make the search.
